# Breeding

Each FreeFlow Life Token owner will have the possibility to breed with other FFLT owners to create other sets or generations of FFLT. For the breeding option to be unlocked, users should have a certain amount of interaction inside the FreeFlow Network.

The breeding will cost 20 U.S Dollars worth of FreeFlow Token (cost equally shared between both parents) and each parent will receive 10 FFTs and will be able to invite 6 members of their circle to join FreeFlow through a FreeFlow Life Subscription.
