# FreeFlow 

<!--TO DO: Insert Image here-->

FreeFlow is the people's new digital universe which allows us to re-experience the simplicity and safety of our childhood and freedom. It is the new internet connecting humanity to humanity. A universe where we can finally be ourselves, be free, feel protected, learn, create, communicate, participate and exchange value. 

FreeFlow is a movement of people allowing themselves to come together as one to say that another world is possible - A world where we can all live in peace, love and harmony. 

We believe that we need to get back to the basics in the way 

We believe that there is a significant need to get back to the basics in the way we interact with each other - Allowing simple essential tools where we own 100% of our data and give no space for the middle man.

We believe in a new global operating function where: 

- **There is no interest**
No money needs to be created out of nothing. Instead, we want to empower a much more sharing/gift economy which will bring stability throughout the whole system. This will encourage in reducing inequalities and division among communities members. We are now from a capitalistic economy to an equalitarian one.  

- **There is no marketing**
From marketing-driven world to a world where reputation and trust will be at the epicenter of an exchange - there will be no unbiased decision-making due to marketing and manipulative adverstisement. 

- **There is no lock-in**
Everyone should be allow to publish, sell, demonstrate everything to everyone. A universe where everyone feel safe and can therefore have 100% trust in the system. An environment that does not encourage you to stay behind your screen but instead show you how connection, communication and freedom in the exterior world are important.
