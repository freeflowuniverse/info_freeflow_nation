FreeFlow Self is your unique digital identity on the FreeFlow universe - in other worlds, it is you in this new digital world. It gives you access to seamless capabilities and experiences. 

FreeFlow Self guarantees that only you has access to your data - no one else, not even us. It encourages a trustful environment without any manipulation attempt from third party to target you with ads or making multiples doppelgangers of you. 

## How much for the FreeFlow Self 

FreeFlow believes in a world where no one should be excluded - It is an initiative to free everyone from the current system miasma. As such, FreeFlow involves the freedom for anyone to be able to decide what will be the amount of contribution distributed to the organization. 
Everyone will have the chance to give birth to his FreeFlow Self.  

Being an evolutionary community based on Trust, **people will have the possibility to freely decide how much they want to contribute for their FreeFlow Self**. This movement is supported by those who realized for themselves and their friends, the benefits of this initiative. Wishing to share these benefits with others, one gives his financial contribution according to oneâ€™s means and volition. Whether this financial contribution is large or small, it should be given with the wish to connect with others and thrive together. In the context of Trust, the FreeFlow community trusts the fairness of your contribution and believes that we are all pieces of a bigger puzzle. 

## How to get a FreeFlow Self 

FreeFlow is based on an invite-only model. You cannot buy a FreeFlow Self, you can only receive it from someone. According to your contribution towards your FreeFlow Self, you will be able to invite a proportionate number of your friends to join & participate in the movement. 

Number of Invites = Contribution Amount x 10%
