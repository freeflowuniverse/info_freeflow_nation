# FreeFlow Poem 

<p align="center">
   A unique poem made on the Nile
</p>

<p align="center">
   Inspired from every place we enter
The sound reverbs, we are gifted the center.
Waking up in the morning and feeling weird
Dave’s hand brings me a coffee and makes me feel cheered.
Every moment recognising my incredible gratitude
Connecting to all and knowing our latitude, 
And deep inside I feel that attraction,
Yes, let me go, I must fly to that mountain.
I will relax, go home, and be a more full person
To weave from love and respect and be more open.
Respecting mother nature and healing the planet
Giving back more than we take and putting love back in it.
The power is within, allow us to forgive,
Full expression and full power to live.
Love is the strongest, that we share with each other,
Continuously expanding and knowing the mother,
Feeling each other in the deepest part
And maintaining with distance connected hearts.
Magical beings are dreaming of a much better world.
With tribalism and fire we will surely be heard.
Feeling seen in all my incredible intensity, 
United with gods and goddesses on life’s journey.
Letting control go, deeply empowering, 
Less mind and more heart, the fire is widening.
