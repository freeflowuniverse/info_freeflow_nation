#Â Success

At ThreeFold we believe the following are the main qualities required to lead our project to success:

### Perseverance

Entrepreneurs who can identify what caused the failure, figure how to fix it as well as improve and make changes, will likely overcome problems and proceed. This ability to overcome, change, sometimes make a pivot and/or move on to the next project is what leads the entrepreneur to success.

This means we accept:

- There is constant change, see [Jungle story](jungle_story).
- Less thinking, More executing, is more important.
- Making mistakes is all good and even needed/normal.

Basically:

- go go go
- make mistakes
- re-adjust
- go go go
- make mistakes
- ... (-:

### Don't think too much!

We have been brainwashed about thinking, we believe its the solution to everything.

We need to think just enough to make sure we have a good chance to do the right thing (20-80% rule) and execute properly.

- **Intuition/feeling instead of over-thinking.**
- **Effective execution instead of over analyzing.**
- **Disciplined around processes.**

> Get out of the mind, into the heart, listen to your intuition (**NOT EGO NOR FEAR**).

### We need to be a responsive organization

> IMPORTANT: Read [responsive org manifesto](responsive_org_manifesto).

| BAD = OLD   | GOOD = Heart Driven |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Profit      | Purpose             |
| Controlling | Empowering          |
| Planning    | Experimentation     |
| Hierarchies | Networks            |
| Privacy     | Transparency        |

> IMPORTANT: Read [agile principles](agileprinciples).

### The Universe is big, we are part of a big living organism.

We believe in living organisms, whatever team we work in operates as a circle as part of other bigger circles.

We constantly need to work with the other circles (our community) in mind

- Use the forum as much as we can, point people to the forum to ask questions. We need to answer there ofcourse as well.
- Don't just chat, make it persistent (forum, wiki), allow the next person to find the info required
- If issue, don't ignore, make issue on right github repo (all of us should do this, its a must)
- ZOOM is not the solution for getting to missing info, github issues/questions or forum is !!! Everyone in the world has equal access to info.
- Share your day to day work with our community:
  - Product delivered/tested
  - Something cool you saw or read about
  - A cool place where you met other people
  - Some cool usecase

> WE ARE THE COMMUNITY, THE COMMUNITY IS US, WE GROW ALL TOGETHER

#### Community first

1. Our technical components as developed.
2. The system we use to collaborate/communicate with our community to let them work with our developed components.

Limit the usage of ad-hoc communication mechanisms like zoom, chat, they are only useful in one point in time.

We need to work in a "GitHub" way, allow thousands of people collaborate for our products.

#### The following is very disrispectful to our community:

- Keep info outdated
  - solution: move old info to an _archive or delete, remove links to it 
- Don't mark when info not usable yet
  - solution: move to new info to a _beta folder
- We don't think enough where to put information (disorganized)
  - solution: be disciplined
- Do everything in 1-group or 1-1 communication e.g. zoom's, make sure questions are answered on right location
  - solution: every communication we do should be usable for larger community
- Are dont use our tools & processes properly (or we are not disciplined)
  - Its needed to allow our community to join and use the fools to to collaborate, everyone needs the chance to collaborate


### Iterative growth

- **What we don't know, we don't know** just let it be, wisdom will come.
- Don't overthink, just go to next milestone, **don't expect a +6months plan**
  - Just accept the fact that the only thing you know is the high level vision
- Focus on next month and 3 months as furthers scope. 
  - If there is a further term goal e.g. launch of a project/product which is further than 3 months then its best to create intermediate steps and focus on those.
- Make sure to work with stakeholders 
  - Can be investors, customers or internal team
  - Make sure you work on right prio's
- Religiously respect the [20-80% percent rule](pareto)
- It's not a sequentual process, don't bet on one horse
  - Always keep multiple paths open if possible
  - Especially for important issues like funding, getting business in, ...
  - In case one path is dead end you can quicky switch over to the other
  - It's a parallel process

Remember & live the [Jungle story](jungle_story).

### Dynamic/Agile collaboration is everything, it requires discipline

> Waterfall or holocracy methods do not work for a startup.<BR>
> Learning the tools, even if complicated is a must.

- Teal is a good principle and works but cannot be implemented as holocracy
  - Scrum/kanban does work
  - Holocracy is role based, doesn't work for org who changes too much
- **Discipline** around the proces is everything
- It's not a pyramid, which means owners cannot choose their own collaboration tools
- Is super important you **understand** the following concepts:
  - Team (scrum) lead: help your team to grow and adhere to the processes
  - Owner = you're not a boss, you own a story or project, this does not make you necessarely a contributor 
  - Contributor - you're one of the people working on a story/fr/bug/question/task/...
  - Stakeholder 
  - [Story](freeflow:stories)
  - Checklist 
  - Fr / bug / question are not stories, they are part of a funnel which then gets pushed through kanban or sprint (scrum)
- Its not about the tools, use what the company/group/community agreed upon, learn if needed
   - If it feels complicated maybe that is because there is no alternative?
   - It's more important to stick to same tool, learning that toolset can well be the most important thing your group/company needs
   

### The core values keep a startup together

Don't take them lightly, they are not a marketing thing.

See [FreeFlow Goals & Values document](goals_values), please do read, its important, if not ok let us know.


### Not everyone is made for startup or growing opensource community

If you are in a startup and you don't agree with above, then maybe you're not in the right spot.
