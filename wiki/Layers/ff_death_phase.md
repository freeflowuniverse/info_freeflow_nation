# The Death

As you die, your home with everything you gathered during your digital life can continue to be hosted and be accessible to the world if you decide to. All the beautiful transcripts of your life and all the digital assets you decided to share can be visited by the people as if it was a living memorial.

As people keep interacting with your home, it will keep generating transcripts and your home will still be able to receive gratitude rewards by your loved ones and these FreeFlow Token will keep participating in paying for the internet capacity required for hosting information you may have shared and which has a significant value to the world. The major role, here, is to provide reliable and valuable information which will be accessible by the future generations.

You can decide, after your death, to give a certain amount of FreeFlow Token to other FreeFlow Self or donate to the Foundation for the purpose of funding impact projects.
