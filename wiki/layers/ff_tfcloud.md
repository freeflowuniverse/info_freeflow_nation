# ThreeFold Peer-to-Peer Cloud

ThreeFold Peer-to-Peer Cloud is a peer-to-peer network of Compute and Storage that is integrated and compatible with the most used developer tools and formats. It uses autonomous and peer-to-peer technology to provide the most decentralized, secure by using a dispersed storage algorithm, and efficient infrastructure to build and store information. On the ThreeFold Peer-to-Peer Cloud, users store and run their files directly on Zero-OS. All transactions on the ThreeFold Grid are done via **ThreeFold Token (TFT)**.

## Why using ThreeFold Technology

Being completely aligned with the collective vision and ability to scale up our solution, FreeFlow opted to support and use ThreeFold Technology for the following reasons:

-   A true peer-to-peer network enables any participant and node to exchange information and value on an end-to-end basis.
    
-   By its peer-to-peer nature, storing and exchanging information and value on the ThreeFold Grid requires less energy than on current web infrastructure (Web 2.0 and Web 3.0). Yet, the internet grid is expected to be carbon negative - offsetting the carbon emission 3 times - through an initiative with their climate education partner.
    
-   (Internet Capacity) Cost-effectiveness - more than 50% cheaper than others on the market.
    
-   Higher performance through the removal of layers of complexities in the internet infrastructure.
    
-   Every individual and organization is sovereign by owning 100% of their data.
    
-   No single point of failure as the system is decentralized, self-driving and self-healing.
