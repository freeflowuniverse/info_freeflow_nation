# Setting up your Home

After giving birth to your FreeFlow Self, you need to create your Home - just as in real life. Powered by the Quantum-Safe File System of ThreeFold, it gives you a space where you can keep all your belongings. With different spaces and rooms, your Home is full of cultural materials such as your books, videos, pictures, texts, the music you produced and listened to.

After organizing your rooms with all the contents you want to share, you decide with whom you want to share and who can or cannot have access to it. All these shared assets will appear in the FreeFlow Space Feed - a space where you can see all the people that opened their houses to you and also filter by type of content of subject that these elements are related to.
