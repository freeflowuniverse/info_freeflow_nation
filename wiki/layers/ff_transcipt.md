# Transcript

Each of these capabilities will generate a transcript representing a certain interaction and micro-narrative that happened within the FreeFlow Network. As such, we will be able to see these transcripts of everything that happened through our FreeFlow Selves and Homes using our content. We will be able to comment on the transcript or give a gratitude reward by sending FreeFlow Tokens to anyone with whom you want to show your affection.

For instance, someone came to my Home after seeing on the FreeFlow Space Feed that I shared the book 1984 from George Orwell. I can see that someone opened it and read it. I can comment: "Happy to see that you were reading here in my house, this book is amazing, we should talk about it!" and that person can answer and give gratitude for sharing such a valuable book - information. That moment when the micro-interaction happened was the moment of pure value creation within the FreeFlow through the Gift Giving and Sharing of Information. The outcomes from these interactions represent the true wealth generated during our lives and transforms us into the mycelium of our earth, its nervous system.
