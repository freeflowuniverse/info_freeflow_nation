# Our Story

As the digital economy keeps on growing at a fast pace, there is a significant need to reinvent a new way of interacting with each other in this digital world. FreeFlow is a virtual homeland and is the backbone interface to connect you to an optimal collective experience on the people's internet - a Web 4.0 technology.

Experiences. Capabilities. Governance. Economy. Tools. Collections.

All sorts of tools to inspire, create, learn and connect with each other. FreeFlow started its experimentation on what happens when trust and cooperation are considered as key drivers to achieve a particular goal - how these can affect the whole and how altruism within a community can create positive outcomes. This can come from mutual concern or voluntarily but never coercively or in one-way only.

**The abundance emerges when the Flow happens and into the power of Dynamics.**

Within FreeFlow, every operation rewards both Participants and the System. Everything is connected in the FreeFlow Universe. The system incorporates transparent governance rules that represent consensus and forkable. Every digital item is owned by you - It is a complete shift from the current centralized model. You host your items and decide if a license should be applied.

All of this information is stored at the heart of your Home. Everything starts with trust and you are a unique version of yourself. [No more clones or digital doppelgangers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CKJtfLV6HU&t=71s) and manipulation of your data. FreeFlow is a community-driven organization where we want to replace fear with trust - bringing back trust into an alternate system. A network-driven environment where transparency is a key value and where money flows as a gift and not from exploitation.

We have the chance of creating an ecosystem where collaboration can overcome the survival of the fittest mindset and every positive intention can join within a planet-first initiative. We, as an individual and as a collective, have the power to make that change and give the order to make the world a better place.
