#  Demurrage-Charged

The FFT is a demurrage-charged utility token. A demurrage charge acts like a parking fee, incurring cost overtime to its holder. The cost for holding onto the FFT currency is estimated at 5.5 - 6% per annum and will support:

1.  FreeFlow Community Treasury
2.  Investment Treasury - Used to support the yield
3.  FreeFlow Reserve
    
The main purpose of the demurrage fee is to encourage a healthy exchange and flow of tokens between members and inside the FreeFlow Universe. For instance, we encourage gift-giving between members, buying goods and services on FreeCycle, investing directly in the Investment Treasury and receiving a positive yield which will help in financing projects, etc.
