#  FreeFlow Governance

FreeFlow is a community-driven organization. Through the network interaction - FreeFlow Gamification - users will receive voting privileges (fairly and equally distributed). These voting rights can be either delegated or non-delegated, implying that users can either vote themselves or give it to someone else who has a better understanding or knowledge on this particular topic. This mechanism provides the space for users having a specific knowledge or specialisation to contribute efficiently to the system.

Voting system is also driven by a reputation system, a positive status game - the more users contribute to the expansion and building-up of the network, the more acknowledgement users will receive.
