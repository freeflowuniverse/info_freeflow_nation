# Pools 
## Collateralized Pool

The FFT will be collateralized by 200% allowing accommodation of up to 50% swing in the reserve currency. This will enable a smooth stabilization of the FFT when the market price will increase or decrease. As we will be using ThreeFold Technology and thus Stellar Blockchain, it will be first collateralized by USDC.

Please note that when Cosmos Network will be deployed on top of ThreeFold Grid, we have the aim to have a standardized basket of the most important commodities represented as digital assets (for instance; Gold). Since it is fully backed by a digital representation of physical commodities, it would be a secure, very robust, and stable mechanism for international contractual and payment purposes.

Cosmos Network is expected to be deployed by the end of Q4 2022.

##  Investment Treasury Pool

This pool is dedicated to fund projects and initiatives driven by the community. By investing in this pool, users will be able to:

1.  Receive a positive yield
2.  Contribute to funding projects within the ecosystem.

The yield follows an Inverted Yield Curve, implying that with an increase in the collected FFT, the yield will decrease. This encourages people at the beginning to invest and receive a positive yield but as soon as the treasury receives enough FreeFlow Token, the yield will constantly decrease.

Each time, the required funding is achieved, the Investment Treasury will be closed for a specific amount of time (for all the process of funding and project support to happen) - this will be communicated to the community - and also incentivize people from the community to keep on transacting in the network.
