# FreeFlow Hub

Built on top of the Web 4.0 technology - the People's Internet - FreeFlow aims at contributing to the expansion of the ThreeFold Grid. FreeFlow introduces the FreeFlow Hub.

FreeFlow Hub (Hub) is the version of ThreeFold 3Node, that gives the adopter the option to decentralize the world's data and workloads while having a native experience to use it. By buying FreeFlow Hub, the adopter will receive an FFLT to join FreeFlow World, while also will receive extra remuneration in exchange for the service provided to the community.

Every time someone decides to join FreeFlow, they should be aware of core community values and beliefs, so the purchasing process of the Hub is also an experience. During the presentation and the onboarding process, the adopter will learn and understand how to live and contribute in a decentralized governance environment.

The People's Internet has a growing public globally, giving an initial step to FreeFlow first adopters. Imagine how great it is to be able to see, use and share an experience of the decentralized internet that you are helping to build. With that, it can be assumed that no one is more interested in the successful adoption of FreeFlow than the owner of a 3Node.
