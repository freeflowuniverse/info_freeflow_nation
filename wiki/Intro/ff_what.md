**Why our interaction on the current internet is unhumanized**

Digital and personal data have been key drivers of digital economic growth throughout history. The growing interactions between data, algorithms, and big data analytics, connected things, and people are opening huge new opportunities. But they are also giving rise to issues around governance at the national and international levels. These include questions around the management of data availability, accessibility, usability, integrity, and security, as well as concerns about ownership, impacts on trade and competition implication for personal privacy, and more. Instilling trust in the use of data is a pre-condition for fully realizing the gains of digital transformation and this is far from being the case right now.

Throughout the years, we have experienced a massive expansion of the big data and data exploitation market.

On top of the above statement, our digital freedom is compromised. With the current centralized infrastructure that constitutes the foundation of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, our personal data is being used to better manipulate and predict our behavior and better target us with ads. Additionally, our interaction with each other on different social platforms dehumanized our human connection. In addition to the collection of data, they make us addicted to the product through their algorithms that are advanced in the psychological understanding of human behavior.

With the actual trend, big tech companies such as Facebook, who prevail centralization of infrastructure, are creating the metaverse which is a persistent virtual world. However, with their current business model based on maximizing the time and level of interaction of users on their platforms to the point of generating, in many cases, documented psychological problems - see Social Dilemma - the current centralized metaverse being developed would be about getting people hooked on the electronic simulation projected a few centimeters from their eyes, which is completely immersive. This would offer, in many cases, a parallel reality more attractive than people's real lives - Already think about the many cases of people obsessively consuming Facebook and Instagram, think about the control, caution, and concern for the possible side effects or potentially harmful effects of an activity driven and commercialized by the company without humanized ethical principles.

Yet, the companies with the highest enterprise value today are digital companies that exploit the enormous capabilities of the world wide web to deliver huge economic benefits to their shareholders. And yet, only a tiny trickle of the enormous bounty of the digital revolution returns to the many. As a result, we are witnessing the widening of economic inequality and social exclusion. This is ironic. The original vision was meant to create the space of sharing and connecting with others and not exploiting the data/information of your peers in order to harness a profit-driven mindset.

Even if the actual digital economy is broken, it is not too late to join hands and through a collective effort, bring a better and fairer digital world to life. Built on top of the new peer-to-peer internet, FreeFlow has the aim to bring the right trustful and safe space for people to exchange, communicate and create.
