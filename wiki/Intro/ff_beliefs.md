# Our Belief

Our belief is deeply ingrained in how we have designed our solution.

We aim at creating a digital world where users are fully sovereign and free to be themselves. Allowing this personal freedom in addition to the user experience provides the right space for a more humanized interaction between each other. Moreover, we commit to getting away from this digital lock-in miasma by leveraging our connection with our outside world - the non-digital world. The journey starts in a digital universe and finishes in nature.

We are a community where the gift-giving principles are anchored among our true essence - We strongly believe that empathy and mutual respect release potential and our community won't be restricted by geography.

Through the gamification inside the FreeFlow Network, rewards should and will be distributed equitably and we commit to creating a digital ecosystem where exploitation and competition won't be encouraged. With transparency as a key to bringing back trust within our community, the collaboration will be an integral part of the system to deliver better outcomes for people, communities, society and the planet.
