There is no doubt, we live at a crossroad. Technology & Innovation are taking an important role in our society. We are more devoted to technology but however, the actual and current system is using it with a different vision. A vision where technology is turning us into easily manipulated products/human beings - where mass surveillance and command & control play a major role - where education brings students into boxes instead of opening their mind - where inequality has never been obvious as before - Where rulers spend countless billions of dollars on warfare, hatred, fear, suspicion and division. We are living in an environment where we have severed our connection with spirit. 

# Our education system is failing

Our educational system actually limits the children's thoughts instead of opening their mind to different perspectives. Most of the information doesn't serve them as individuals, they lack socials skills and do not understand how important their relationships with the exterior enviroment and nature are. It is based on the theory of "Survival of the Fittest" where competition, Pyramids Scheme and Exploitation are favored to Collaboration, Participatory and Regeneration respectively.

With the current internet infrastructure, our data is stored in data centers owned by big tech corporation. These data are sold, without our approval, to third parties like Companies and Governments. With the data collection, they make representations of us and we don't own them - Actually internet users may have hundreds or thousands of digital identities held by those entities. 

As a matter of fact, the data industry has thousands of data points on digital users and a user combined data points are worth between $1 to $20k per year. All of these data points are collected to build tailor-targeted ads.
