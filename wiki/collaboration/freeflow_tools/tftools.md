# Tools Used For ThreeFold

## project/task management

### if content/code related

- github (wiki, websites, promotion)

### if coordination/business

- circles tools
- integrates with threefold connect
- we will make better reporting tool (has been promised for a long time)

> how to use our circles tool see [howto_circles_projects](circles_tools)

## content 

All info needs to be in one of below ...

### wiki (publishtools)

> use as much as possible.

Link customers/proposals to wiki's as much as possible.

Its easy to create new wiki's and link to it.

why

- version controlled
- easy to use as single source of truth

remark

- can edit using publishing tools on own computer (more advanced)
- can edit directly using github or [docs.threefold.me](http://docs.grid.tf/)
- [docs.threefold.me](http://docs.grid.tf/) is used when really private and cannot be on MS owned github

### cryptpad (OLD)

> CRYPTPAD NO LONGER NEEDED, WE CAN NOW USE GDOC AND USE DOCSEND FOR SHARING WITH CUSTOMERS

make sure docs are on right location, we had cryptpad to share with customers, but because we can do over docsend for now ok.

### gdrive


- [Link to the root of the Circles Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ww8CF3zPCVKhlyAhWO9WCqZZoHhA2hBl)
<!-- - [READ THIS IMPORTANT HOWTO](strategy:tfhowto_gdrive) -->

> we cannot work on any project if the info is not nicely organized in one of above

**allways use gdrive for**

- contracts
- big files
- presentations (use master slides with right templates)
- visual docs

## future tools

- the digital twin + publishing tools (but more easy to use) will become the default for everything
- all stories, funnels, tasks, issues will be managed starting from text
- documents will be on digital twins
