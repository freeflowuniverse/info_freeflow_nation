# Manage Meetings

Meetings need to be actively managed.

- as few as possible
- keep them short
- PREPARE THE MEETING
- DO NOT MEET/DISCUSS if there is no doc/issue on wiki/github or circles
- only discuss what is already prepared and on doc (wiki)
- make sure the people on the meeting have prepared
- force to use our wiki system / github or circles
- make sure everyone gets the info afterwards
- follow up on what is needed

### What do do if

- Meeting goes over topics not prepared:
  - better to postpone to next meeting
  - ask to create preparation (story, issue, fr, wiki, ...)
  - if super urgent and it cannot be done otherwise, respect time & make sure the preparation will be done afterwards
- Meeting goes over time:
  - tell people and bring them back to the purpose
  - scrum meeting <15 min
  - stakeholders meetings absolute max <60 min (do not discuss if not prepared !!!)
- Meeting becomes emotional:
  - keep everyone positive & focussed
  - if not prepared, no need to discuss now
- Some people on meeting are not positive:
  - ask then to change attitude
  - if not possible stop meeting
- You are in a meeting and the meeting owner cannot do above:
  - tell meeting owner about the issue, if no improvement ask to stop meeting

### Remark

- TIME is a precious good, treat it as such, be respectful for people around you
