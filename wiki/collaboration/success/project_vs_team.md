# Project vs Team

- team: people, links to the stories in project, product, ...
- projects = project,product,funnel, ...= content, the thing we have to work on

> when we speak about project in this doc we mean project, product, funnel ...

## Purpose of the team

- show who is inside & their roles
- grow/nurture a group, of "humans" working together
- help people to evolve in their personal journey with us 
- the team lead = is a coach, there are no decisions to be taken
- purpose of the kanban
  - show prio's of he team at this point
  - **the content of the stories/issues is not in the circle**
- people should try to only belong to one team
- teams are used to organize priorities, not define the things to do
- [READ MORE ABOUT TEAM HERE](circle_type_team)

## Purpose of project, funnel, milestones, product...

- discuss a deliverable, objective
- expose this content to customer, partner, world, ...
- measure progress
- try to work with scrum (sprints = milestones) compared to only kanban
- people belong to many projects, funnels, products, ...
- projects can have many members
- the project coordinator needs to manage a project, not team
- if the project coordinator needs work to be done or resources, coordination with relevant teams can be required

## Owner <> Team lead

- [Owner](owner)
- [Team lead](team_lead)
