# specifications guidelines

- put all specs in the relevant product repositories, together with the code
- if useful this content can be served through our publishing tools (see crystal universe) = our main wiki tool
    - markdown docs which are hosted on github
    - its very easy to include markdown docs from any other repo 
        - you have info_.... repo and inside use include macros to include from the right code repo's
        - which means much of the specs can be markdown docs part of your code repo's itself
    - its very easy to link to any content
    - its very easy to include code e.g. python code fragments on the wiki pages
    - has support for including slides from google presentations (use this for other drawings)
        - all slides need to be in gdrive from TF Tech    
- what about drawings
    - ONLY USE google drawing or slides, put in comment link to the google doc used
    - make screenshots or include the drawing (can publish & include as image)
- mindmups can be used as well
    - THEY need to be in incubaid team folder !!!
    - put in comments link in markdown the link to the mindmup
    - publish the mindmup (don't forget to redo it when you make changes) and embed or link to it from your markdown document
    
# please do not

- do not use other external drawing tools
- do not create in other tools and then expose as png, ... everything needs to be editable
- do not put specs in a story or issue or FR (stories should link to the specs in github or on wiki location)
