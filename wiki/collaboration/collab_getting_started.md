# Getting Started

## requirements

- we are still using gdrive for now (will be migrated later): get yourself an account on the incubaid gdrive (see Roel)
- get github account and learn how to use it (sorry)
- install threefold_connect on your phone
- login into circles.threefold.me & forum.threefold.io

## Tools to get comfortable with

- circles_tools (important to be 100% up to date with this)
- github, at least how to work with projects, issues, edit markdown docs
- cryptpad (for anything which does not fit in wiki and we need to share with our community/customers)
- publishing tools for everyone who needs to edit wiki more regulary, [start here](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_config_private)

## TOP RULES

- never keep docs in your own folder on gdrive, always directly work on the folder of the company
- **use _beta/_archive concept**
- all info we create/update needs to be in one of the following locations (**NO WHERE ELSE PLEASE**)
    - a github of the org you're working for (this results in wiki, website, ...)
    - cryptpad if we share something with people (we cannot use gdrive to share)
    - gdrive (see the links below)
    - forum (content for our generic audience if threefold)
    - circles tool (our project mgmt tool)
    - gitea (private git tool only for technical users, for nothing else)
